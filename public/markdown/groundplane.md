# Tracking time with Groundplane!

To start your PCB, first we want a method to track time. Instead of getting you to use Wakatime for your EDA (can be VERY buggy), we want to use more of a journaling system (like how I track time in my day). We want to stop judging projects based solely on how long they take. We want to encourage you to be creative and come up with new ideas, and we want to reward you for your creativity and the quality of the PCB! For this very reason, I built Groundplane—an all-in-one PCB devlog software to make your devlogs easy.

## What is Groundplane?

Groundplane is a time tracker that you can use to track your time using devlogs. It doesn't really track time, but more the devlogs of your projects and progress! Remember, the time tracking is trust-based and if you commit fraud we will know! **(Please don't.)**

## Getting Started

To get started with using Groundplane, head to [https://groundplane.hackclub.com](https://groundplane.hackclub.com) and log in with Slack! (If you don't have an account, head over to [https://hackclub.com/slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) and join the Slack.) You can then start tracking your time and devlogs!

When you first open Groundplane, you will see something like this:

![Groundplane landing page](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/5d20aadd45e9a4c73d470b475b9d89089bb59876_image.png)

Go ahead and click **Get Started**. You should be brought to a page like this:

![Groundplane login page](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/83e6da24a59699a6abdb8d0bbe6ef61b0fd90bb9_image.png)

Once you click **Login with Slack**, it will redirect you to Slack login, and once that is done it will bring you to the main page that looks something like this:

![Groundplane main dashboard](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/c045abff86cb1f5fbb6f3046e0a0204dfbf80aad_image.png)

Now this is the main page where you can perform all your actions!

On the top right, you should see a **Create Project** button like this:

![Create Project button location](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/e16c5b1f3ada73b255628cd877e028300373848a_image.png)

Once you click this, you can begin setting up your first project!

The fields are pretty self-explanatory. Here is a picture of my example:

![Project creation form example](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/2bfa663d6408fcdd43f6d2328178299d9cdae821_image.png)

Once you click **Create**, Groundplane should redirect you back to the home page and your project should appear!

![Project card on homepage](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/50f41858b20da2562141c12d4e901bd2c65bc665_image.png)

On the project card, you have a couple of options:

![Project card options](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/1b091a5fbbe125a79dbddfa0c432c86211485b62_image.png)

### You can:

- Edit the project details (Name, Description, GitHub URL)
  - **NOTE:** MEDIA CANNOT BE CHANGED AFTER PROJECT CREATION (If you are desperate, contact @AaravJ on Slack)
- Delete the project
  - **NOTE:** THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE
- View the project GitHub Repository
- Go more in-depth into the project to start creating devlogs!

From here, you want to click the **View Project** button on the project card, and it will redirect you to your project page:

![Project page view](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/497005a4cd4f623c2e9c1aac9dcf756f36e40ae2_image.png)

Now on the project page, there are 2 sections:

1. Your project details containing the cover image and description of the project
2. Your devlogs

What are devlogs, you may ask? Devlogs are a new way of tracking project progress that we made (inspired heavily by Highway devlogs).

We want to encourage you to document your projects step-by-step, as that is a great way to view progress and mistakes, and we judge your project based on these devlogs!

Once you click **Create Devlog** in the bottom section:

![Create Devlog button location](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/8f4b61b9c509040cef45fe003dc16d9e804fc00c_image.png)

You will be brought to a long-ish form that allows you to submit your devlog.

In this form, you need to enter:

- Project Name (Automatically Entered)
- Dev Log Tag (What are you working on? PCB, CAD, etc.)
- Title (A title for your devlog!)
- What You Did (An in-depth description of what you accomplished that session)
- Issues Faced (What issues did you face while building your project)
- Next Steps (What next steps do you plan on taking to either resolve those issues or continue your project)
- Time Spent (How much time did you spend this session)
  
  **KEY NOTE:** Please be honest with this. If you are not honest, we WILL find out, and your project will be invalidated. Please keep in mind we are a non-profit with limited funds. Devlog time will also be reviewed by our team to prevent fraud.

- Screenshot or Video (This is the most important step — share a screenshot or video of what you did in this session! What did you accomplish and how does it look? We want to see!!)

After that, you can go ahead and submit your devlog and wait for review!

After creating a devlog, if you click **View Project** again, you should see it under here like so:

![Devlog with pending approval status](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/8da2d7aa9bd45cb2cff2e66e6082e0780d3c47b7_image.png)

If you look closely, you can see how it says **pending approval**. This means that one of the organizers needs to manually review your devlog and approve it.

![Pending approval indicator](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/74a3aa90cb9b00c049d7d13f13952f8a03086589_image.png)

Once your devlog is approved, it should look something like this:

![Approved devlog view](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/f56b2324c67b55033713671a7b836d35ebba0511_image.png)

## Project Completion

Once you finish your project, reach out to **@AaravJ** on Slack to mark it as completed and fill out the form (will be given to you)!
