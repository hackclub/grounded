# Grounded Hardware Grant

---

We have a lot of stuff in a bin at Hack Club and I need your help to turn the parts into projects!

You can use any of the components below to create a project along with:

- Up to $30 for a PCB (not PCBA) board
- Up to $20 for other parts you may need
- Free 3D prints through `#print-legion`

## How to get approved

Each project is individually reviewed. There is no limit to the complexity or the number of components required. Here are some tips to get accepted:

- Don't keep it simple! Make a 3d printed case, add a pcb to link the components
- Don't use more expensive component or a component that is not needed. If you use a Raspberry PI Pico to blink a light, you will be rejected.
- Make a nice polished final project and make sure everything works. If possible, model your project in Wokwi.

## Getting Started

### 1. Join `#electronics` and `#grounded` on Slack!

Our [#electronics](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0948RT0C1M) channel is where the party is getting started! Sign up to our community via [this link](https://hackclub.com/slack/?event=grounded).

### 2. Create your Github Repo & Start Your Journal

#### If you rather not manage a journal, check out `#Groundplane` on the sidebar

Create a git repository for your project! Most people use GitHub, but you can use any git provider you want.

#### üìù Start Your Journal (Required for any custom projects!)

Create a `JOURNAL.md` file in your repo. At the very top, include the following data:

```
---
Title: "Your PCB Project Name"
Author: "Your name (name or slack username)"
Description: "Describe your PCB project in a short sentence!"
Created On: "10/7/2025"
---
```

**Journaling or #Groundplane is mandatory for custom Hardware grants!**

#### How to Journal Your Project

Document your progress every day! The general formatting should look like this:

```
# June 8th: Got the screen to work!

[actual journal content - what did you do?]

[insert pictures of what you're working on!]

**Total time spent: 2h**
```

**Do NOT have:**
- Wall of timestamps with barely any descriptions
- No images
- Terrible formatting that's impossible to read
- AI generated journal entries; anything written by AI will be immediately rejected

### 3. Design your project

Look at the available parts below and start your project. A typical project will have a 3d model and if it is possible to, make a [Wokwi Simulation](https://hackclub.com/slack/?event=grounded) of your circuit.

*If you get stuck or want more example projects, post in the Slack channel.*

Just remember to update your journal throughout your entire project.

## Parts Inventory

Check the parts inventory on the sidebar!

### 4. Submit your project

Once your project is fully designed, make sure you have a `JOURNAL.md`, the files for your project and any Wokwi links to your simulated circuit in your project. Once that is all good, fill out the form below to submit your project:
